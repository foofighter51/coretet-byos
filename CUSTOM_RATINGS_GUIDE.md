# Custom Section Ratings - User Guide

## Setup Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration (REQUIRED)
```sql
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
-- Run the migration from: database/migrations/v1_custom_rating_system.sql
```

This creates:
- 8 default rating categories (vibe, lyrics, melody, progression, rhythm, production, energy, originality)
- All necessary tables for the rating system

### 2. Create Audio Sections First
Since ratings are tied to track sections, you need sections to rate:

1. Open a track in Track Details
2. Look for the "Arrangements" section (currently shows "Coming Soon")
3. You'll need to create audio_sections entries in the database:

```sql
-- Example: Create sections for a track
INSERT INTO audio_sections (track_id, name, start_time, end_time, color, created_by)
VALUES 
  ('your-track-id', 'Intro', 0, 30, '#FF6B6B', 'your-user-id'),
  ('your-track-id', 'Verse 1', 30, 90, '#4ECDC4', 'your-user-id'),
  ('your-track-id', 'Chorus', 90, 120, '#45B7D1', 'your-user-id'),
  ('your-track-id', 'Verse 2', 120, 180, '#4ECDC4', 'your-user-id'),
  ('your-track-id', 'Bridge', 180, 210, '#96CEB4', 'your-user-id'),
  ('your-track-id', 'Outro', 210, 240, '#FFEAA7', 'your-user-id');
```

- Run the database migration
- Check if rating_categories table has data

**Ratings not saving**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check Supabase RLS policies

**Filter not working**
- Ensure sections have ratings first
- Check if section_ratings table has data
