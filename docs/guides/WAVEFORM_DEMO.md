# Waveform Visualization Component

## Overview

I've created two waveform visualization components for CoreTet:

### 1. **WaveformVisualization** (Canvas-based)
- Full-featured waveform using Web Audio API
- Analyzes actual audio data to generate accurate peaks
- Canvas rendering for smooth visualization
- Hover effects and precise time display
- Best for desktop/detailed views

### 2. **WaveformBars** (CSS-based) âœ… Currently Used
- Lightweight CSS-based visualization
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Simulated waveform (can be upgraded to real analysis)
- Click to seek functionality
- Responsive and touch-friendly

## Current Implementation

The waveform is now integrated into the Track Details modal:
- Shows below the header, above track information
- 40 bars representing the track duration
- Click any bar to seek to that position
- Shows progress when track is playing
- Displays time labels (0:00 - duration)

## Features

1. **Visual Feedback**
   - Bars change color to show playback progress
   - Current position indicator line
   - Hover effects on bars

2. **Interaction**
   - Click to seek to any position
   - Responsive to current playback state
   - Updates in real-time during playback

3. **Performance**
   - CSS-based rendering (no canvas)
   - Minimal re-renders
   - Smooth animations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Audio Analysis**
   - Implement actual waveform generation from audio data
   - Cache waveform data in database
   - Progressive loading for large files

2. **Section Markers**
   - Add ability to mark sections on the waveform
   - Visual indicators for intro, verse, chorus, etc.
   - Drag to create sections

3. **Zoom and Pan**
   - Zoom in for precise editing
   - Pan through long tracks
   - Mini-map overview

4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Touch gestures for scrubbing
   - Pinch to zoom
   - Haptic feedback

## Usage Example

```tsx
<WaveformBars
  audioUrl={track.url}
  trackId={track.id}
  height={60}
  barCount={40}
  onSeek={(time) => seek(time)}
/>
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the current implementation
2. Add real audio analysis (optional)
3. Implement section management on top of waveform
4. Create expanded track view with larger waveform
