# Auth Timeout Fix - User Upload Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
User experiencing "Auth initialization timed out" error, preventing login and file uploads.

## Root Causes
1. **Short timeout period**: Auth initialization had only 10 seconds timeout
2. **No retry mechanism**: Single failure meant complete auth failure
3. **Network issues**: No handling for slow/unreliable connections

## Fixes Applied

### 1. AuthContext.tsx - Enhanced Auth Initialization
- **Increased timeout**: 10 seconds â†’ 30 seconds
- **Added retry logic**: Up to 3 automatic retries on failure
- **Better error handling**: Network errors trigger automatic retries
- **Graceful degradation**: User can still use app even if profile load fails

### 2. Profile Loading Improvements
- **Added timeout protection**: Profile load has 15-second timeout
- **Retry mechanism**: Up to 3 retries for profile loading
- **Non-blocking failures**: Profile load failures don't prevent app usage

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build and deploy the updated code**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your hosting service
   ```

2. **Monitor for improvement**:
   - Check if user can now log in successfully
   - Verify upload functionality works
   - Monitor console for retry messages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with slow network**:
   - Use browser dev tools to throttle network
   - Verify retries are working

2. **Test with Supabase issues**:
   - Temporarily block Supabase domain
   - Verify graceful timeout and retry

## For Affected Users

If users are still experiencing issues:

1. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Clear site data in browser settings

2. **Check network**:
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Try different network if possible

3. **Browser compatibility**:
   - Use modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari latest versions)
   - Disable aggressive ad blockers temporarily

## Monitoring

Watch for these console messages:
- "Retrying auth initialization (attempt X/3)..." - Normal retry behavior
- "Auth initialization failed after maximum retries" - Complete failure after all retries
- "Profile load failed, retrying..." - Profile loading retry

## Success Indicators
- User can log in within 30 seconds
- Uploads work immediately after login
- No "Auth initialization timed out" errors in console
