# Final Simple Solution

## Decision: Keep Public Bucket with Database RLS

### Why this is secure enough:
1. **UUID paths** - 3 layers of UUIDs make URLs unguessable
2. **Database RLS** - Users can only see their own tracks in the UI
3. **No directory listing** - Can't browse files without exact URLs
4. **Good for your scale** - You're the only user currently

### Architecture:
```
User → App → Database (RLS) → Public Storage URLs
```

### Security comparison:
- **Current approach**: Security by obscurity + database RLS
- **Edge function approach**: True access control but complex

### For future multi-user:
When you have paying users, you can:
1. Migrate to S3 with CloudFront signed URLs
2. Or implement the edge function approach properly
3. Or use a dedicated media streaming service

### Benefits of keeping it simple:
- Audio playback works NOW
- No complex authentication issues
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Can focus on features instead of infrastructure

### The pragmatic choice:
Perfect security isn't needed for a single-user app. Get it working, get users, then improve security when it matters.

## Clean up code:
1. Remove references to deleted tables
2. Keep using public URLs
3. Focus on your core features
