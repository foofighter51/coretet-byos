# Testing View Preferences Database Integration

## What Changed

1. **Database Storage**: View preferences (sorting, filtering, view mode) now save to the `view_preferences` table instead of localStorage
2. **Automatic Migration**: Existing localStorage preferences will be migrated to the database on first use
3. **Cross-Device Sync**: Preferences will now work across different devices/browsers when logged in with the same account

## How to Test

1. **Clear your browser cache** to ensure you're starting fresh
2. **Log in** to the application
3. **Navigate to different views** and change sorting:
   - Go to a category (e.g., "Songs")
   - Change sort to "Title" ascending
   - Go to a playlist
   - Change sort to "Artist" descending
   - Go to a collection
   - Change sort to "Duration" ascending

4. **Clear cache again** and log back in
5. **Verify preferences persisted**:
   - Navigate back to each view
   - Sorting should be exactly as you left it

## Expected Behavior

- Each view (category, playlist, collection, etc.) maintains its own sort preferences
- Preferences load from database on login
- Changes save automatically without any lag in the UI
- If you had existing preferences in localStorage, they'll be migrated automatically

## Database Verification

You can verify the data is being saved by running this query in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT 
  view_type,
  view_id,
  sort_by,
  sort_direction,
  view_mode,
  updated_at
FROM view_preferences
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

This will show all your saved view preferences.

## Troubleshooting

If preferences aren't persisting:
1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Ensure you're logged in (preferences only save for authenticated users)
3. Check that the RLS policies are working by running the query above
