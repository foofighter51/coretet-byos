# AI Development Guidelines

## Core Principles (Both Claude Code & Copilot)
1. **Minimize code changes** - Fix rather than replace
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Consistency over perfection
3. **Document why, not what** - Focus on intent
4. **Test before committing** - Verify all changes
5. **Clean as you go** - Refactor incrementally

## Task Division

### Claude Code Responsibilities
- Architecture decisions & design patterns
- Complex debugging & root cause analysis
- Code reviews & refactoring strategies
- Performance optimization planning
- Security considerations
- Breaking down complex requirements

### GitHub Copilot Responsibilities
- Auto-complete function implementations

## Part 2: Daily Operations Prompts

### 2.1 Morning Startup Sequence

```markdown
## Daily Session Initialization

I'm starting a new development session with both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot configured. 

**Step 1: Load Previous Session**
Please read and analyze the EOD status file: `./docs/eod-status/[YESTERDAY'S DATE]-eod.md`
(or the most recent file in that directory if yesterday's doesn't exist)

From that file, extract and summarize:
1. Completed tasks from last session
2. Outstanding/carried-over tasks
3. Known issues or blockers
4. Work in progress that was stashed
5. Any specific notes for today

**Step 2: Acknowledge Working Principles**
1. Code Quality > Quantity - Fix and refactor before adding
2. Minimal Changes - Smallest possible changes to achieve goals
3. Preserve Working Code - Don't modify functioning code without explicit permission
4. DRY Principle - Eliminate duplication, suggest shared utilities
5. Clear Communication - Explain what, why, and impacts before changes

**Step 3: AI Integration Setup**
- GitHub Copilot: ENABLED for autocomplete and boilerplate
- Claude Code: Leading architecture and review decisions
- Both following: .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc configurations
- Code markers in use: TODO, FIXME, AI-REVIEW, COPILOT-GEN

**Step 4: Generate Today's Plan**
Based on the EOD status file, propose:
1. Top 3 priorities for today (considering carryover tasks)
2. Realistic time estimates for each
3. Any blockers that need addressing first
4. Suggested order of operations

Please provide the summary and wait for my confirmation or adjustments before we begin.
```

### 2.1.1 Alternative Startup (No Previous EOD File)

```markdown
## Fresh Session Initialization 

No previous EOD status file found. Let's establish context:

**Step 1: Codebase Analysis**
Please scan the project for:
1. Recent commits (last 5) to understand recent work
2. Current TODO/FIXME markers in code
3. Open files in the workspace (if any)
4. Test suite status
5. Any uncommitted changes

**Step 2: Project Context**
- Project: [PROJECT NAME]
- Tech Stack: [AUTO-DETECT OR CONFIRM]
- Current branch: [git branch --show-current]

**Step 3: Create Initial Task List**
Based on your analysis, suggest:
1. Obvious issues that need attention
2. Incomplete implementations (look for TODO markers)
3. Tests that are failing or skipped
4. Code marked with AI-REVIEW

**Step 4: Initialize EOD Tracking**
Create directory: `./docs/eod-status/`
We'll create our first EOD file at the end of this session.

Please provide your analysis and suggested priorities.
```

### 2.2 Task-Specific Prompts

#### New Feature Implementation
```markdown
## Feature Implementation Request

**Feature:** [FEATURE NAME]
**Priority:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

Before implementing:
1. Review existing codebase for reusable components
2. Identify integration points with current architecture
3. Plan minimal implementation approach
4. List any new dependencies needed

**Copilot Integration Note:** I'll use Copilot for routine implementations. Please review any sections marked with `// COPILOT-GEN:` for architectural consistency.

Outline your implementation approach before we begin coding.
```

#### Debugging Session
```markdown
## Debugging Focus

**Issue:** [DESCRIBE BUG]
**Affected Areas:** [LIST FILES/FUNCTIONS]
**Expected vs Actual:** [DESCRIBE BOTH]

Approach:
1. Identify root cause without assumptions
2. Propose minimal fix
3. Preserve all working functionality
4. Add `// FIXME:` comments for related issues discovered
5. Verify fix doesn't introduce new issues

Note: Copilot is DISABLED (Alt+C) for this debugging session to maintain focus.
```

#### Code Review Request
```markdown
## Code Review - Mixed AI Sources

Please review recent changes in [FILES/FOLDERS]. This includes:
- Human-written code
- Copilot-generated sections (marked with `// COPILOT-GEN:`)
- Previous Claude Code suggestions

Review for:
1. **Consistency:** Does all code follow our established patterns?
2. **Quality:** Any code smells or anti-patterns?
3. **Efficiency:** Unnecessary duplication or complexity?
4. **Safety:** Potential bugs or edge cases?
5. **Documentation:** Are AI-generated sections properly documented?

Mark approved sections with `// CLAUDE-APPROVED:` and issues with `// AI-REVIEW:`.
```

### 2.3 End of Day Procedures

#### Daily Wrap-up Prompt
```markdown
## End of Day Status Generation

Please create an EOD status report by:

**Step 1: Analyze Today's Work**
1. Review git diff for all changes made today
2. List commits made (git log --oneline --since="today")
3. Check current branch status
4. Identify any uncommitted work

**Step 2: Task Accounting**
Review today's planned tasks (from morning session) and categorize:
- ‚úÖ Completed tasks (with commit references)
- üîÑ In Progress (with current state)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked (with reason)
- üìù New tasks discovered today
- üêõ Bugs found but not fixed

**Step 3: Code Quality Summary**
- New TODO/FIXME markers added
- AI-REVIEW sections pending
- Complexity warnings introduced
- Test coverage impact

**Step 4: Generate EOD Markdown**
Create file: `./docs/eod-status/[YYYY-MM-DD]-eod.md`

Use this template:
