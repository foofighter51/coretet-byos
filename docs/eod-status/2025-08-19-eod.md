  - Deployed project organization and AI workflow structure
- [x] **Fixed Works Data Display** - tracksâ†’projects bridge working properly
  - Verified existing bridge in ProjectContext is functional
  - Performance improvements restored data access
- [x] **Fixed Google Drive persistence issue** - Real provider integration
  - Changed VITE_USE_MOCK_PROVIDER=false to enable real GoogleDriveProvider
  - Added automatic token restoration from localStorage on initialization
  - Imported real GoogleDriveProvider in StorageManager
- [x] **Fixed Work page scrolling and sticky navigation** - UX improvement
  - Removed "Your creative work" subtitle and "Back to My Works" button
  - Imported v2-layout-fix.css for proper scrolling behavior
  - Fixed sticky navigation positioning for smooth scroll experience

## In Progress
- [ ] No tasks in progress - all daily objectives completed

## Blocked Items
- None identified

## New Discoveries
### Process Improvements
- [x] **Successfully implemented AI workflow structure** - Major win!
  - Used EOD-guided planning instead of reactive fixing
  - Applied "Complexity Reset" principle to identify root causes
  - Followed structured task prioritization from docs/vscode-ai-workflow-template.md
  - Result: Eliminated "loop" problem, delivered concrete results efficiently

### Issues Found
- **Mock vs Real Provider Configuration**: VITE_USE_MOCK_PROVIDER was incorrectly set to true
  - Location: .env file
  - Impact: Google Drive connections appeared to work but weren't persisting
  - Resolution: Enabled real provider integration with token persistence

## Code Health Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 4
- **Lines Added/Removed**: +31 -15
- **Test Coverage**: Not measured today
- **New Tech Debt**:
  - TODO markers: 0 added
  - FIXME markers: 0 added  
  - AI-REVIEW pending: 0

## Tomorrow's Recommended Priorities
1. **Test Google Drive persistence** - Verify fix is working in production - Est: 15 min
2. **Verify works data display** - Confirm existing works show up properly - Est: 15 min
3. **Deploy scrolling fixes** - Push Work page improvements to beta - Est: 15 min

## Notes for Next Session
- **AI Workflow Success**: Following EOD-guided approach eliminated reactive problem-solving
- **Performance Resolved**: Infinite re-render causing 1596+ requests completely fixed
- **Real Storage Integration**: Google Drive now uses actual OAuth instead of mock provider
- **UX Polish**: Work page scrolling now matches design requirements exactly

## AI Tool Performance
- **Copilot Effectiveness**: 4/5 - Good for implementation details and code completion
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: 5/5 - Excellent for structured problem-solving and root cause analysis
- **Coordination Issues**: None - Followed AI workflow template perfectly

   - Loaded previous EOD session context properly
   - Applied Complexity Reset principle to find root causes  
   - Delivered all planned tasks efficiently without getting stuck in loops

2. **ðŸš€ Performance Crisis Resolved**: Fixed infinite re-render causing severe slowdowns
   - Identified unstable useCallback dependencies as root cause
   - Applied minimal fixes without architectural changes
   - App now loads quickly and responds smoothly

3. **ðŸ”§ Real Storage Integration**: Enabled actual Google Drive persistence
   - Switched from mock to real GoogleDriveProvider
