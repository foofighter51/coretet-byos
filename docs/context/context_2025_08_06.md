# CoreTet Development Context - August 6, 2025

## Current Status
The application has been significantly enhanced with a comprehensive Tasks feature for tracking song-related to-dos. The Arrangements feature remains functional but with playback still not implemented. Several UI improvements have been made to enhance the user experience.

## Major Changes Since August 3rd

### 1. Tasks Feature Implementation (Commit: e3c28a2)
A complete task management system has been added to help users track production-related tasks for each track.

#### New Components
- **TasksList** (`/src/components/Tasks/TasksList.tsx`) - Main task management interface with:
  - Drag-and-drop reordering using @dnd-kit
  - Filtering by completion status and category
  - Inline editing and quick actions
  - Priority levels (low, medium, high)
  - Due date tracking
  
- **TaskForm** (`/src/components/Tasks/TaskForm.tsx`) - Task creation/editing form with:
  - Title and description fields
  - Priority selector
  - Category dropdown
  - Due date picker
  
- **TaskItem** (`/src/components/Tasks/TaskItem.tsx`) - Individual task display with:
  - Checkbox for completion
  - Inline editing capability
  - Color-coded categories
  - Priority indicators
  
- **SortableItem** (`/src/components/Tasks/SortableItem.tsx`) - Wrapper for drag-and-drop functionality

- **Tasks Summary Page** (`/src/pages/TasksSummary.tsx`) - Overview page showing:
  - Tasks grouped by track
  - Filter by completion status
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Track selection for detailed view

#### Database Schema
- **`tasks` table** - Core task storage with fields for:
  - Track and user associations
  - Title, description, completion status
  - Priority levels, categories, due dates
  - Custom ordering support
  
- **`task_categories` table** - Predefined categories:
  - Lyrics (Green)
  - Arrangement (Blue)
  - Recording (Red)
  - Mixing (Yellow)
  - Mastering (Purple)
  - Marketing (Pink)
  - Other (Gray)

#### Integration Points
- Tasks section added next to Notes in TrackDetailsPanel
- New Tasks Summary page accessible from sidebar
- Database migration pending (see TASKS_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### 2. UI/UX Improvements

#### Player Enhancements
- **InlinePlayer** now includes timeline with seek functionality
- Visual progress bar for track playback
- Click-to-seek capability

#### Navigation Updates
- Changed Final Versions icon from Star to Award for better clarity
- Added Tasks icon (CheckSquare) to sidebar navigation
- Made header layout responsive to prevent menu overlap on resize

#### Track List Improvements
- Enhanced track selection visibility with better highlighting
- Now shows variation counts for all tracks in variation groups
- Improved visual hierarchy in track listings

### 3. Feature Placeholders
- Version History temporarily replaced with "Feature Coming Soon" message
- Arrangements edit button shows similar placeholder
- These features are still in development but hidden to avoid confusion

### 4. Package Updates
- Added @dnd-kit packages for drag-and-drop functionality:
  - @dnd-kit/core
  - @dnd-kit/sortable
  - @dnd-kit/utilities
- Added date-fns for date handling in tasks

## Migration Status

### ✅ Database Migration Complete
The Tasks feature database migration has been successfully applied:
- `tasks` and `task_categories` tables created
- RLS policies are active
- Helper functions for reordering are available
- Default categories have been populated

### Migration Files (For Reference)
- `TASKS_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `apply_tasks_migration.sql` - Migration script (already applied)
- `supabase/migrations/20250806_create_tasks_schema.sql` - Source migration file

## Current Architecture Updates

### Updated Component Structure
```
/src/components/
├── Tasks/                    # NEW - Task management components
│   ├── TasksList.tsx        # Main task interface
│   ├── TaskForm.tsx         # Task creation/editing
│   ├── TaskItem.tsx         # Individual task display
│   └── SortableItem.tsx     # Drag-drop wrapper
├── Arrangements/            # (Unchanged from last context)
└── ...other components
```

### New Routes
- `/tasks-summary` - Tasks overview page with track grouping

## What's Working
- ✅ Complete Tasks CRUD operations (fully functional with database)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop task reordering
- ✅ Task filtering and categorization
- ✅ Priority and due date tracking
- ✅ Inline player with seek functionality
- ✅ Improved track selection visuals
- ✅ Responsive header layout

## What's Not Working Yet

### From Previous Context (Still Pending)
1. **Arrangement Section Playback** - Still needs AudioContext enhancement
2. **Arrangement Builder** - Drag & drop interface for arrangements

### New Items
1. **Version History** - Currently showing placeholder
2. **Arrangements Edit** - Currently showing placeholder

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Test Tasks Feature** - Verify full functionality with live database
2. **Re-enable Features** - Remove placeholders for Version History and Arrangements
3. **Implement Section Playback** - As outlined in previous context

### Short-term Goals
1. **Complete Version History** - Full implementation
2. **Polish Tasks UI** - Additional features like bulk operations, templates
3. **Enhance Arrangements** - Add missing functionality

### Long-term Goals
1. **Arrangement Builder** - Full drag-drop arrangement creation
2. **Task Templates** - Quick-start templates for common workflows
3. **Task Analytics** - Track productivity and completion rates

## Important Notes

### Tasks Feature Deployment
- ✅ Database migration completed successfully
- Tasks feature is now fully operational
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own tasks
- 404 errors should no longer appear in console

### UI State
- Placeholders are temporary to avoid user confusion
- All underlying code for Version History and Arrangements remains intact
- Can be re-enabled by removing placeholder logic in TrackDetailsPanel

### Testing Considerations
- Tasks feature requires user authentication
- Tasks are track-specific and user-specific
- Drag-drop requires modern browser with pointer events support
