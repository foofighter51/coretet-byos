# Coretet Development Context - July 31, 2025

## Project Overview
Coretet is a music library management application built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It features track management, playlists, collaborative features, and a custom audio player with waveform visualization.

## Recent Session Summary (July 31, 2025)

### Morning Session - Major UI Overhaul

1. **Collapsible Sidebar with Icon Mode**
   - Sidebar now defaults to collapsed (icon-only) state
   - Removed "CoreTet" title from sidebar (only in header now)
   - Added popup menus when clicking section icons in collapsed state
   - "All Tracks" renamed from "Library" as primary navigation item
   - Playlists and Collections moved lower in hierarchy

2. **Enhanced Search System**
   - Moved search from sidebar to header for prominence
   - Created EnhancedSearch component with autocomplete
   - Shows suggestions based on track titles, artists, and notes
   - Stores and displays recent searches in localStorage
   - Added SearchFilterChips showing active filters below header

3. **Streamlined Player Controls**
   - Created minimal InlinePlayer component in header
   - Includes play/pause, previous/next, and volume controls
   - Removed bottom PlayerBar to save screen space
   - No track name display for cleaner interface

4. **UI Cleanup**
   - Removed music note icons from track titles
   - Removed clock icons from duration displays
   - Removed tags icon from header (accessible via sidebar)
   - Bulk actions (Edit, Variations, Clear, Delete) only show for 2+ selections
   - Applied custom forest theme scrollbars globally

### Major Accomplishments Since July 30

1. **Interactive Tutorial System Enhancement**
   - Changed overlay from dark (80% black) to light (40% gray) for better visibility
   - Fixed tooltip positioning to stay within viewport bounds
   - Added intelligent positioning that flips tooltips when near edges
   - Added Track Variations section explaining the VAR feature
   - Expanded playlist sharing section with detailed collaboration info
   - Added Coming Soon section highlighting upcoming features
   - Improved content formatting with better spacing and icons
   - Synced both tutorial modals with consistent content

2. **Waveform Compression Bug Fix**
   - Fixed bug where waveform appeared compressed on first track after login
   - Used container width instead of canvas width for waveform generation
   - Added proper scaling when drawing waveform to handle size mismatches
   - Ensured canvas is properly sized before generating waveform data
   - Added delay to handle initial sizing after login
   - Only resize canvas when dimensions actually change

3. **Feedback System Implementation**
   - Created Edge Function (send-feedback) for handling user feedback
   - Integrated with Resend API for email notifications
   - Added file attachment support for feedback
   - Stores feedback in database with fallback if email fails
   - Sends formatted emails to coretetapp@gmail.com

4. **Arrangements Feature - Database Ready**
   - Created complete database schema for arrangements feature
   - Added tables: audio_sections, arrangements, arrangement_sections
   - Implemented comprehensive RLS policies for security
   - Created TypeScript interfaces for type safety
   - Ready for UI implementation

### Syntax Error Resolution Session
1. **TrackList.tsx Syntax Errors**
   - Encountered unterminated JSX contents error when attempting multiple UI updates
   - Root cause: Attempted too many simultaneous JSX structure changes
   - Solution: Reverted to last working version and applied changes incrementally
   - Successfully removed tags dropdown from header
   - Prepared placeholder for inline player integration
   - Updated bulk actions to show only for 2+ selections
   - All state references to tags dropdown cleaned up

### Current State
- All changes committed and pushed to main branch
- Interactive tutorial working with improved UI/UX
- Waveform rendering reliably without compression issues
- Feedback system operational with email notifications
- Arrangements database schema ready for implementation
- TrackList.tsx stable with partial UI updates applied

- [x] Manual order mode only activates when selected
- [x] Save Order button appears/works correctly
- [x] Toast notifications appear properly
- [x] Waveform displays and interacts correctly
- [x] Search in sidebar works
- [x] Dropdowns don't get cut off
- [x] All CRUD operations work
- [x] Tutorial system works with proper positioning
- [x] Feedback system sends emails correctly

## Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy Edge Functions
supabase functions deploy send-feedback
```

## Environment Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase project with proper schema
- Environment variables configured
- Resend API key for feedback emails

## Remaining Issues to Address
1. **Uncomment InlinePlayer in TrackList.tsx** - Currently placeholder div
2. **Uncomment SearchFilterChips import** - Component ready but not integrated
3. **Verify MainApp.tsx still has PlayerBar commented out** - Replaced by inline player

## Next Session Starting Points
1. **Continue Phase 3: Track List Enhancement** - Add virtualization and inline metadata
2. **Complete Phase 4: Bulk Operations Toolbar** - Already shows for 2+ selections
3. **Begin Phase 5: Expanded Metadata Editor** - Comprehensive fields and templates
4. **Consider Database Schema Updates** - May need to support version tracking before UI
5. **Implement Arrangements UI** - Original priority, now part of larger track-centric vision
   - Create ArrangementEditor component
   - Add section marking tools to DetailedWaveform
   - Build arrangement playback controls
   - Implement section management UI
   
6. Add unit tests for new components (Toast, DetailedWaveform, Tutorial)
7. Optimize performance for large music libraries
8. Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
9. Add batch operations for track management

## Important Context for AI Assistant
- The app uses Supabase for backend with RLS policies
- Audio files are stored in Supabase Storage
- Secure URLs are fetched via Edge Function with fallback to public URLs
- View preferences are stored per user/context in database
- Manual ordering uses track positions stored in playlists/collections
- The app supports collaborative playlists with shared ratings
- Soft delete is implemented with 30-day recovery period
- Feedback system uses Resend API for email notifications
- Tutorial system uses React Portal for overlay and highlighting

## UI/UX Design Decisions
- **Sidebar collapsed by default** - Maximizes track list space
- **Popups for collapsed sections** - Maintains functionality without clutter
- **Search in header** - More prominent and discoverable
- **Inline player** - Always accessible without dedicated space
- **Bulk actions conditional** - Reduces visual noise for single track operations
- **No redundant icons** - Cleaner, more professional appearance

## Recent Bug Fixes to Remember
1. Audio 400 errors - Always use secure URL fetching with fallback
2. Manual order auto-enabling - Check isManualOrderMode state, not just sortBy
3. Dropdown positioning - Use left alignment to avoid sidebar conflicts
4. Z-index stacking - Middle column needs relative z-30 for dropdowns
5. Waveform compression - Use container width, not canvas width for sizing
6. Tutorial tooltips - Implement viewport boundary detection for positioning

## Database Schema Updates
- Added arrangements feature tables (audio_sections, arrangements, arrangement_sections)
- Comprehensive RLS policies for collaborative editing
- Indexes added for performance optimization

## Edge Functions
- `send-feedback` - Handles user feedback with email notifications via Resend

This context should help you quickly get back up to speed with the current state of the Coretet project and continue development seamlessly.
