# CoreTet BYOS - End of Day Status
## August 15, 2025

---

## üéØ **Major Accomplishments Today**

### ‚úÖ **Fixed Critical Track Display & Playback Issues**
- **Problem**: Tracks were importing successfully (12 tracks) but not appearing in library
- **Root Cause**: LibraryContext was querying for deprecated `storage_path` field instead of BYOS fields
- **Solution**: Updated field mapping to use `s3_key`, `storage_provider`, `provider_file_id`, `provider_url`
- **Result**: All imported Google Drive tracks now display correctly in library

### ‚úÖ **Resolved Google Drive Audio Streaming (403 Forbidden)**
- **Problem**: Tracks loaded but wouldn't play - "403 Forbidden" errors on Google Drive URLs
- **Root Cause**: Using `webContentLink` which requires authentication, not suitable for direct streaming
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `getStreamingUrl.ts` utility for provider-aware URL generation
  - Added `GoogleDriveProvider.getStreamUrl()` for authenticated streaming URLs
  - Updated `AudioContext.playTrack()` to be BYOS-aware
- **Result**: Google Drive tracks now play successfully with authenticated URLs

### ‚úÖ **Completed BYOS Core Infrastructure**
- ‚úÖ Database schema with BYOS fields
- ‚úÖ Storage provider abstraction layer  
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth integration with broader drive scope
- ‚úÖ Folder browsing and selection UI
- ‚úÖ Import functionality creating proper database records
- ‚úÖ Track display with BYOS field support
- ‚úÖ Audio playback with provider-specific streaming URLs

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Database Schema (BYOS Fields)**
```sql
-- Added to tracks table:
storage_provider TEXT DEFAULT 'supabase',
provider_file_id TEXT,
provider_url TEXT,
s3_key TEXT (nullable for BYOS),
-- Plus existing: file_name, file_size, ai_recommended_tags, analysis, etc.
```

### **Key Files Modified**
- `src/contexts/LibraryContext.tsx` - Fixed field mapping, added BYOS-aware URL generation
- `src/contexts/AudioContext.tsx` - Updated playTrack() to use provider-specific streaming
- `src/utils/getStreamingUrl.ts` - **NEW** Utility for storage provider URL resolution
- `src/services/storage/providers/GoogleDriveProvider.ts` - Added getStreamUrl() method
- `src/pages/StorageSettings.tsx` - Implemented actual import functionality
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added missing BYOS fields to Track interface

### **Google Drive Integration**
- **OAuth Scope**: `drive.file` + `drive.readonly` for existing file access
- **Import Process**: Discovers audio files ‚Üí Creates track records with BYOS fields
- **Streaming URLs**: `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/{fileId}?alt=media&access_token={token}`
- **Authentication**: Automatic token refresh and validation

## üéµ **Current Functional Status**

### **Working Features**
- ‚úÖ Google Drive OAuth connection
- ‚úÖ Browse Google Drive folders with audio file counts
- ‚úÖ Select and import folders (tested with 24 tracks total)
- ‚úÖ Track display in CoreTet library (24 tracks showing)
- ‚úÖ Storage provider abstraction working
- ‚úÖ User authentication and profile management
- ‚úÖ Fixed LibraryProvider/AudioProvider context ordering

### **Known Issues**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing personal_track_ratings table**: Looking for `personal_track_ratings` table that doesn't exist
  - Error: `GET .../personal_track_ratings?...` 404 (Not Found)
  - Impact: Track ratings/liked/loved functionality broken
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Drive streaming still has issues**: Audio error events despite authenticated URLs
  - Still getting audio errors on some Google Drive files
  - May need different streaming approach or URL format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TasksSummary component errors**: Looking for `tasks` and `task_categories` tables that don't exist
  - Error: `Could not find the table 'public.tasks' in the schema cache`
  - Non-blocking: Task management feature not core to music functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No metadata extraction**: Tracks import without duration, artist, etc.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No real-time sync**: Changes in Google Drive not detected

## üöß **Immediate Priorities (Next Session)**

### **Priority 1: Fix Database Schema Issues**
- [ ] **Fix missing personal_track_ratings table** - Critical for track rating functionality
- [ ] Debug Google Drive streaming URLs - some tracks still have audio errors
- [ ] Fix or disable TasksSummary component 404 errors

### **Priority 2: Complete Audio Playback**
- [ ] Test current Google Drive streaming implementation
- [ ] Investigate alternative URL formats if needed (direct download vs streaming)
- [ ] Ensure all imported tracks are playable

### **Priority 3: Metadata Extraction**
- [ ] Implement audio file metadata extraction (duration, artist, title, etc.)
- [ ] Add metadata extraction to import process
- [ ] Update existing imported tracks with metadata

---

## üìã **Complete Task Backlog**

### **Phase 1: Core BYOS Functionality** ‚úÖ *COMPLETED*
- [x] Create BYOS database schema migration
- [x] Implement storage provider abstraction layer
- [x] Implement Google OAuth integration
- [x] Create folder selection UI for existing files
- [x] Implement folder import functionality
- [x] Debug track display issues
- [x] Fix Google Drive streaming URLs

### **Phase 2: Enhancement & Stability** üîÑ *IN PROGRESS*
- [ ] **Fix missing personal_track_ratings table causing 404 errors** ‚ö° *Critical*
- [ ] **Debug Google Drive streaming URLs - audio errors persist** ‚ö° *High Priority*  
- [ ] **Fix task/tasks table confusion causing 404 errors** ‚ö° *Next*
- [ ] **Implement metadata extraction from audio files** ‚ö° *High Priority*
- [ ] Test import functionality with various Google Drive folder structures
- [ ] Add import progress indicators and better UX
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic for failed imports

### **Phase 3: Multi-Provider Support**
- [ ] **Implement Dropbox OAuth integration**
- [ ] Create unified multi-provider interface
- [ ] Add provider switching and management features
- [ ] Implement provider-specific optimizations

- [ ] Implement automatic metadata extraction and enhancement
- [ ] Add bulk editing and organization tools
- [ ] Create data export functionality (CSV/XLS)

### **Phase 5: Collaboration & Sharing** ü§î *ARCHITECTURE DECISION NEEDED*
- [ ] **Research and design sharing architecture for BYOS tracks**
  - Problem: Google Drive tracks with user tokens can't be shared directly
  - Need to decide: Hybrid storage vs. Proxy streaming vs. Copy-on-share
- [ ] Implement mobile app integration strategy
- [ ] Design cross-platform collaboration workflows
- [ ] Address cloud storage access limitations for shared tracks

## üß† **Strategic Considerations Identified**

### **Sharing/Collaboration Challenge** 
Today's discussion revealed a critical architectural challenge:

**Problem**: Google Drive (and Dropbox) tracks use user-specific authentication tokens, making direct sharing impossible:
- User A's tracks in Google Drive can't be played by User B
- Mobile app would need individual OAuth for each collaborator's cloud storage
- Playlist sharing becomes complex with mixed storage providers

**Potential Solutions** (needs research):
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Personal storage (BYOS) + shared storage (CoreTet) when sharing
2. **Proxy Streaming**: CoreTet server handles all cloud authentication
3. **Copy-on-Share**: Move tracks to shared storage when collaborating

**Decision Needed**: This impacts the entire collaboration model and needs architectural review.
