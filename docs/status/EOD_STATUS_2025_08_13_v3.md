# End of Day Status - August 13, 2025 (V3)

## Summary
Successfully resolved all critical playlist functionality issues including 406 errors, drag-and-drop, sorting, and UI layout. The application is now stable and ready for testing with all major features working correctly.

## Completed Today

### 1. Fixed 406 "Not Acceptable" Errors
- **Root Cause**: Using `.single()` instead of `.maybeSingle()` in useViewPreferences hook
- **Solution**: Changed to `.maybeSingle()` to properly handle cases where preferences don't exist yet
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/src/hooks/useViewPreferences.ts`
  - `/database/migrations/fix_view_preferences_manual_sort.sql`

### 2. Enabled Drag-to-Playlist Functionality
- **Issue**: Tracks couldn't be dragged from library to sidebar playlists
- **Root Cause**: Draggable attribute was on play button instead of track row
- **Solution**: Moved draggable attribute to entire track row element
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/src/components/Library/TrackListView.tsx`

### 3. Implemented Sortable Column Headers
- **Features Added**:
  - Click-to-sort on all column headers
  - Visual indicators for sort direction (arrows)
  - Persistent sort preferences per view context
  - Smart default directions based on column type
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/components/Library/TrackList.tsx`
  - `/src/components/Library/TrackListView.tsx`

### 4. Fixed Playlist Sorting System
- **Issue**: Sorting didn't work in some playlists due to always preserving saved order
- **Solution**: Added `preserveOrder` parameter to `getPlaylistTracks()`
- **Features**:
  - Manual order as default for playlists
  - Proper persistence of manual positions
  - Smooth switching between sort modes
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/contexts/LibraryContext.tsx`
  - `/src/utils/trackSorting.ts`

### 5. Added Playlist Deletion
- **Features**:
  - Delete button in playlist view
  - Confirmation dialog
  - Smooth transition back to All Tracks (no page reload)
  - Proper cleanup of associated data
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/components/Library/TrackList.tsx`
  - `/src/components/MainApp.tsx`

### 6. Reorganized UI Layout
- **Improvements**:
  - Better spacing between control groups
  - Context-aware button visibility
  - Clearer visual hierarchy
  - Separated bulk actions from playlist controls
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/components/Library/TrackList.tsx`

### 7. Fixed Sidebar Collapse State
- **Issue**: Sidebar wouldn't collapse in playlist view
- **Solution**: Added playlist context to collapse logic
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/components/Layout/Sidebar.tsx`

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Review "Variations" button visibility in playlist views
2. Clean up project structure (archive old migrations, screenshots)
3. Implement shared playlists functionality
4. Add commenting system for shared playlist tracks

### Technical Debt
- Multiple migration files that could be consolidated
- Test screenshots that should be archived
- Potential redundancies in sorting logic

### Feature Requests
- Shared playlists appearing under dedicated section
- Comments on tracks in shared playlists
- Comment visibility for all users with access

## Database Changes
- Added support for 'manual' sort_by option in view_preferences
- Updated check constraints and RPC functions
- Migration: `fix_view_preferences_manual_sort.sql`

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test drag-and-drop from library to multiple playlists
2. Verify sorting persistence across sessions
3. Test playlist deletion with various track counts
4. Verify manual order saves correctly
5. Check UI responsiveness at different screen sizes

## Deployment Status
- All changes committed to main branch
- Deployed to production
- Ready for user testing

## Files Modified Summary
- 8 files changed
- 398 insertions(+)
- 189 deletions(-)
- 1 new migration file

## Performance Notes
- Virtualized list view for >100 tracks
- Efficient caching of collection track orders
- Optimized re-renders for drag operations
