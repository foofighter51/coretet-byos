-- SAFE TEST FOR SHARING FUNCTIONALITY
-- This version checks if tables exist before querying them

-- 1. Check if playlist_shares table exists
SELECT

        ELSE '‚ùå Table missing - run CREATE_SHARING_SYSTEM.sql first'
    END as status;

-- 2. Check current user has playlists to share
SELECT 
    'Available Playlists' as test,
    COUNT(*) as playlist_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ You have ' || COUNT(*) || ' playlists to share'
        ELSE '‚ùå No playlists found - create one first'
    END as status

-- 3. List your playlists with track counts
SELECT 
    'Your Playlists' as section,
    p.id,
    p.name,
    COUNT(pt.track_id) as track_count,
    p.created_at::date as created
