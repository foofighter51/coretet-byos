-- VERIFY COMPLETE SHARING SYSTEM
-- Run this after applying all policies to verify everything is working

-- =====================================================
-- 1. CHECK ALL POLICIES ARE IN PLACE
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- 2. TEST BASIC ACCESS FOR CURRENT USER
-- =====================================================

-- Get current user info
SELECT

-- Test access to each table

-- 3. TEST SHARING FUNCTIONALITY
-- =====================================================

-- 5. PERFORMANCE CHECK - Ensure no recursion
-- =====================================================

-- This query would fail or timeout with recursive policies
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, TIMING OFF)
