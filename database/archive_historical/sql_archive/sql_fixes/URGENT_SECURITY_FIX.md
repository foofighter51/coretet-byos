# URGENT: Security Fix Required

## Critical Issue
All users can currently access all audio files because:
1. The storage bucket is set to PUBLIC
2. There's a policy allowing anonymous access
3. The tracks RLS policy is too permissive

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Run the Emergency SQL Migration
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor immediately:
```sql
-- From: /supabase/migrations/20250126_EMERGENCY_fix_storage_security.sql
```

### 2. Verify Storage Bucket is Private
Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → audio-files → Settings
- Ensure "Public bucket" is UNCHECKED

### 3. Move Existing Files (if needed)
If you have files not in user folders, they need to be moved.
The migration updates the database paths, but files need manual moving in Supabase Storage.

### 4. Test Access
After applying fixes:
1. Main user should only see their own tracks
2. Collaborators should only see tracks in playlists shared with them
3. Public URLs should no longer work

## What These Fixes Do

1. **Makes storage bucket private** - Only authenticated users with proper permissions
2. **Removes anonymous access** - No more public file access
3. **Enforces folder-based isolation** - Users can only access files in their folder
4. **Fixes overly permissive RLS** - Separates owned tracks from shared tracks
5. **Maintains collaborator access** - Through explicit playlist shares only

## Mobile App Issue
The mobile app not showing shared playlists is likely because:
1. The user needs to accept the invitation first (check email)
2. The status might still be 'pending' not 'active'

## Next Steps
1. Apply the security fix immediately
2. Test that main users can't see each other's tracks
3. Verify collaborators can only see shared playlist tracks
4. Monitor for any access issues
