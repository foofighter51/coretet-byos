# EOD Status Report - CoreTet V2 Beta
## Date: 2025-08-09

### ðŸŽ¯ Today's Accomplishments

#### âœ… Core V2 Infrastructure
1. **Songwriter-Focused Redesign**
   - Shifted from album/label perspective to songwriter POV
   - Entry point: Simple "Create a Work" or "Upload Audio"
   - Works â†’ Versions â†’ Iterations hierarchy implemented

2. **Database Schema**
   - Created 5 V2 tables: projects, song_versions, version_iterations, project_collaborators, version_metadata
   - Added artist column to projects table
   - Fixed RLS policies for song_versions and version_iterations

3. **User Interface Components**
   - **SongwriterDashboard**: Clean entry with two primary actions
   - **CreateWorkModal**: Simple title + optional artist
   - **WorkDetailEnhanced**: Comprehensive single-page work management
   - **WorkVersionUpload**: Audio upload with version management
   - **WorkNotes**: Timestamped notes system
   - **WorkTasks**: Task management with priorities

4. **Features Ported from V1**
   - Multi-select dropdowns (genre, mood, time signature)
   - Comprehensive metadata editing
   - Notes and tasks functionality
   - Version/iteration hierarchy

### ðŸ”´ Current Issues

1. **Critical: RLS Policy Recursion**
   - Error: "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'projects'"
   - Cause: Circular reference between projects and project_collaborators
   - Solution provided: v2_005_fix_projects_rls_recursion.sql (needs to be run)

2. **Auth Timeout**
   - Intermittent "Auth initialization timed out after 60 seconds"
   - May need to review auth refresh logic

3. **Missing Features**
   - Waveform visualization not implemented
   - Audio playback controls needed
   - Collaboration features temporarily disabled

### ðŸ“‹ Immediate Next Steps

1. Run the RLS recursion fix migration
2. Test work creation and viewing
3. Implement audio playback
4. Add waveform visualization
5. Create Works list page

### ðŸŽ¨ Overnight Plan

1. **Design Iterations** (3-5 versions)
   - Different visual approaches for songwriter workflow
   - Mobile-responsive designs
   - Collaboration-focused layouts
   - Timeline/history views
   - Progress tracking visualizations

2. **Code Review**
   - Audit all V2 code for conflicts/redundancies
   - Review database schema optimization
   - Check for unused imports and dead code
   - Validate TypeScript types consistency

3. **Artist POV Enhancements**
   - Intuitive onboarding flow
   - Visual progress indicators
   - Quick-action shortcuts
   - Collaboration invitation system
   - Version comparison tools

### ðŸ“Š Beta Site Status

- **URL**: beta.coretet.app
- **Branch**: develop
- **Environment**: VITE_ENABLE_V2=true
- **Status**: Functional but needs RLS fix

### ðŸš€ Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Review overnight design iterations
2. Choose preferred approach
3. Implement audio playback
4. Add collaboration features
5. Create onboarding flow

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

The shift to songwriter POV is working well. The simplified entry point ("Create a Work" vs complex project setup) aligns with how artists actually think about their creative process. The version/iteration model maps naturally to the demo â†’ rough mix â†’ final master workflow.
