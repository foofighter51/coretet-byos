# End of Day Status - August 13, 2025

## Summary
Successfully resolved critical playlist sharing functionality issues and deployed all fixes to production. The system is now fully operational with shared playlists working for both web and mobile applications.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Migration Fixes
- **Issue**: `relation 'idx_tasks_track_id' already exists` error
- **Solution**: Created `apply_tasks_migration_safe.sql` with IF NOT EXISTS clauses
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully applied

### 2. Supabase Security Warnings
- **Issue**: Three views using SECURITY DEFINER causing security warnings
- **Affected Views**:
  - `playlist_track_rating_summary`
  - `my_shared_playlists`
  - `deleted_tracks`
- **Solution**: Removed SECURITY DEFINER, views now use SECURITY INVOKER
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

### 3. Authentication & Profile Issues
- **User**: ericexley@hotmail.com
- **Issues Resolved**:
  - Auth timeout errors
  - 406 errors on view_preferences
  - 500 errors (infinite recursion in RLS policies)
  - 403 errors (permission denied for table users)
- **Status**: ✅ All authentication issues resolved

### 4. Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies
- **Issue**: Circular references between `playlists` and `playlist_shares` tables
- **Solution**: 
  - Broke circular dependencies
  - Created one-way reference policies
  - Simplified policy structure
- **Files**: `fix_infinite_recursion_policies.sql`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

### 5. View Preferences Table
- **Issue**: Table missing or had incorrect structure
- **Solution**: Created table with proper columns and RLS policies
- **Files**: `fix_view_preferences_structure.sql`
- **Status**: ✅ Table created and working

### 6. Permission Denied Errors
- **Issue**: Policies trying to query `auth.users` table directly
- **Solution**: Replaced with `auth.email()` function
- **Files**: `fix_users_permission.sql`
- **Status**: ✅ All permission errors resolved

### 7. Playlist Sharing Functionality
- **Issue**: Shared playlists not working for web and mobile apps
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed database policies for playlist_shares
  - Updated LibraryContext to load both owned and shared playlists
  - Ensured proper email-based sharing mechanism
- **Files**: 
  - `fix_playlist_sharing_complete.sql`
  - `src/contexts/LibraryContext.tsx`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional

### 8. Documentation Organization
- **Action**: Created Status folder and organized all status/context documents
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Deployment
- **Branch**: main
- **Commit**: e31a07d - Fix playlist sharing functionality and resolve database issues
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed to production

## Key Technical Improvements

### Database Policy Architecture
- Eliminated circular references in RLS policies
- Implemented cleaner one-way policy references
- Used built-in auth functions instead of direct table queries

### Frontend Updates
```typescript
// LibraryContext now loads both owned and shared playlists
const dbPlaylists = [
  ...(ownPlaylists || []),
  ...(sharedData?.map(share => share.playlists) || [])
];
```

### Migration Best Practices
- All migrations now use IF NOT EXISTS clauses for idempotency
- Safe migration scripts can be run multiple times without errors

## Current System State
- ✅ Authentication working for all users
- ✅ Playlist creation and management functional
- ✅ Playlist sharing operational for web and mobile
- ✅ No infinite recursion errors
- ✅ No permission denied errors
- ✅ View preferences table properly structured
- ✅ All database migrations successfully applied

## Files Modified/Created Today

### Database Migrations
- `database/migrations/apply_tasks_migration_safe.sql`
