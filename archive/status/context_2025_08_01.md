# CoreTet Development Context - August 1, 2025

## Current State Summary

### Today's Session Overview
We continued from July 31, 2025, implementing a track-centric UI redesign based on user feedback. The focus has been on making tracks/songs the primary organizational unit rather than playlists/collections.

### Major Accomplishments Today

1. **Phase 5: Expanded Metadata Editor** ✅
   - Added comprehensive metadata fields (music theory, production, technical, rights, links)
   - Created yellow-bordered section matching Track Information styling
   - Removed confusing template functionality based on user feedback
   - Added separate edit controls with save/cancel buttons

2. **Lyrics Section** ✅
   - Added dedicated Lyrics box next to Extended Metadata
   - Matched 2/3 + 1/3 width split like Track Information/Tags
   - Independent edit controls
   - Stored in extended metadata JSON structure

3. **Phase 6: Version Control System** ✅
   - Implemented Version History UI with timeline view
   - Visual timeline with version numbers and timestamps
   - Set primary version functionality
   - Delete version with protection
   - Version comparison showing differences
   - Placeholder for creating new versions (requires backend file duplication)

### Current UI Layout

#### Header
- CoreTet logo (left)
- Enhanced search bar with autocomplete (center)
- Inline player (yellow box with track title, play/pause, volume)
- Bulk action controls (only visible when 2+ tracks selected)
- List/Grid view toggle
- User menu (right)

#### Sidebar (Collapsed by Default)
- Icons only, no text
- No "CoreTet" text (removed as redundant)
- Popup windows for sections when clicked:
  - My Library
  - My Playlists
  - Shared Playlists  
  - Collections
  - Ratings
  - Tags

#### Main Track List
- Virtual scrolling for performance (>100 tracks)
- Inline metadata display (BPM, Key, Last Updated)
- No music note or clock icons
- VAR count badges for tracks with variations
- Ratings controls (listened, liked, loved)
- Grid layout prevents UI jumping

#### Track Details Panel (Right Side)
- Waveform with playback controls
- Track Information (2/3) + Tags (1/3)
- Extended Metadata (2/3) + Lyrics (1/3)
- Version History with timeline
- Notes section
- Sections (placeholder)
- Arrangements (placeholder)

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Extended Metadata Storage
- Stored in `notes` field as JSON
- Preserves backward compatibility
- Separates plain text notes from structured metadata
- Utility functions in `src/utils/metadataUtils.ts`

#### Key Files Modified/Created Today
- `/src/components/TrackDetails/ExpandedMetadataEditor.tsx` - New comprehensive metadata editor
- `/src/components/TrackDetails/VersionHistory.tsx` - New version control UI
- `/src/components/TrackDetails/TrackDetailsPanel.tsx` - Updated with new sections
- `/src/utils/metadataUtils.ts` - Metadata handling utilities

### User Preferences & Instructions

1. **Simplicity First**: Remove confusing features (like templates) until user feedback indicates need
2. **Visual Consistency**: Yellow borders and titles for major sections
3. **Independent Controls**: Each section should have its own edit/save/cancel buttons
4. **No Assumptions**: Don't add features without explicit request
5. **Track-Centric**: Emphasize individual tracks over collections/playlists
6. **Minimal by Default**: Collapsed sidebar, bulk actions only when needed

### Current Todo List Status

#### Completed (High Priority)
- ✅ Phase 1: Enhanced Search
- ✅ Phase 2: Collapsible Sidebar  
- ✅ Phase 3: Track List Enhancement
- ✅ Phase 4: Bulk Operations Toolbar
- ✅ Phase 5: Expanded Metadata Editor
- ✅ Phase 6: Version Control System UI

#### Pending (Priority Order)
1. **Phase 7: Advanced Filtering** (Medium Priority)
   - Add sort/filter capabilities
   - Filter by metadata fields
   - Save filter presets

2. **Phase 8: Mobile Optimization** (Medium Priority)
   - Responsive track management
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Mobile-specific layouts

3. **Phase 9: Performance Optimization** (Medium Priority)
   - React.memo implementation
   - Additional virtualization
   - Bundle size optimization

4. **Phase 10: Database Schema Updates** (Medium Priority)
   - Add version tracking tables
   - Optimize queries
   - Add indexes

5. **Phase 11: API Layer Updates** (Medium Priority)
   - Track-centric operations
   - Batch operations
   - Performance improvements

6. **Arrangements UI** (Low Priority)
   - Create ArrangementEditor component
   - Section marking tools
   - Arrangement templates

### Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Version Creation**: Currently shows placeholder message - needs backend file duplication
2. **Hover Tooltips**: Not working properly in some components
3. **Bundle Size**: Main chunk over 500KB - needs code splitting
4. **Service Worker**: Cache version updates on every build

### Next Steps When Resuming

1. **Immediate**: Test all recent changes after OS update
2. **Next Feature**: Begin Phase 7 - Advanced Filtering
3. **Consider**: User feedback on version history UI
4. **Future**: Implement actual version creation with file duplication

### Environment & Technical Details
- **OS**: macOS (updating to Sequoia 15.6)
- **Node**: Latest version
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with custom forest theme
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Deployment**: Netlify with GitHub integration

### Important Context
- Working directory: `/Users/ericexley/Downloads/coretet_no_ai`
- Current branch: `main`
- Live deployment: Auto-deploys on push to main via Netlify
- Date confusion: System shows January 2025, but actual date is August 1, 2025

### Session Commands & Patterns
- Build: `npm run build`
- Commit pattern: Descriptive message with bullet points
- Always test builds before committing
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress
- Read files before editing to avoid conflicts

### Final State Before Break
- All changes committed and pushed
- Build successful
- Version History UI complete
- Ready for Phase 7 implementation

## Quick Resume Checklist
1. [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies
2. [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify clean build
3. [ ] Check git status for any uncommitted changes
4. [ ] Review this document for context
5. [ ] Start with Phase 7: Advanced Filtering

Remember: The UI is now track-centric with emphasis on individual song management rather than collections. Keep the interface simple and only add features when explicitly requested.
