# Start of Day Status - August 12, 2025

## Session Summary
Successfully implemented a custom rating system with enhanced track details layout, including like/love ratings, comments system, and improved UI organization. Fixed critical user access issues affecting login and file uploads.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Custom Rating System Implementation
- **Detailed Ratings Component**: Created like/love system for rating categories (vibe, lyrics, melody, progression, rhythm, energy)
- **Database Infrastructure**: Set up tables for `track_detailed_ratings`, `track_comments`, and `rating_categories`
- **Real-time Updates**: Implemented real-time comment subscriptions using Supabase

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- **3-Column Layout**: Reorganized TrackDetailsPanel with Notes (left), Tasks (middle), Detailed Ratings (right)
- **Comments Section**: Added full-width comments below main interaction areas
- **Overflow Fixes**: Resolved Tasks component bleeding into adjacent columns
- **Key Organization**: Grouped major/minor keys together (C Major, C Minor, C# Major, C# Minor...)

### 3. New Fields Added
- **Tuning Field**: Added for instrument-specific tuning information
- **Lyrics Field**: Added with owner-only editing permissions
- **Comments System**: Timestamped comments with username display

### 4. Critical Bug Fixes for User Access
- **Fixed 406 Errors**: Created view_preferences table with proper RLS policies
- **Fixed InvalidKey Upload Errors**: Enhanced filename sanitization for special characters
- **Fixed Missing Profile Records**: Ensured all auth users have corresponding profiles
- **Specific User Fix**: Resolved JG user (jonathangreener@gmail.com) login and upload issues

## Database Migrations Applied
1. `create_comments_and_detailed_ratings.sql` - Core tables for comments and ratings
2. `safe_rating_categories_migration.sql` - Rating categories with default values
3. `add_tuning_and_lyrics_fields.sql` - New metadata fields
4. `fix_jg_user_SAFE.sql` - Fixed user access issues and missing profiles

## Current System State

### Working Features
- ✅ Track library with advanced filtering
- ✅ Audio playback with waveform visualization
- ✅ Notes system with timestamps
- ✅ Tasks management (pending full migration)
- ✅ Detailed Ratings with like/love buttons
- ✅ Comments with real-time updates
- ✅ Playlist creation and management
- ✅ File upload with metadata editing
- ✅ 6 color themes
- ✅ PWA support

### Known Issues (Resolved)
- ~~406 errors on view_preferences~~ ✅ Fixed with proper RLS policies
- ~~InvalidKey upload errors for special characters~~ ✅ Fixed with enhanced sanitization
- ~~Missing user profiles~~ ✅ All users now have profiles
- Tasks table requires migration (`apply_tasks_migration.sql`) - Optional
- Auth timeout errors in console (non-blocking)

### Environment
- **Dev Server**: Running on port 5174
- **Branch**: develop
- **Last Commit**: 692b389 - "Fix JG user login and upload issues"
- **Remote**: Pushed to origin/develop
- **Production Deploy**: Successfully deployed to https://coretet.app at 20:28 UTC

## File Structure Changes
```
New Components:
- src/components/TrackDetails/DetailedRatings.tsx
- src/components/TrackDetails/TrackComments.tsx
- src/components/TrackDetails/SectionRatingPanel.tsx
- src/hooks/useCustomRatings.ts
- src/types/customRatings.ts

Modified:
- src/components/TrackDetails/TrackDetailsPanel.tsx (layout reorganization)
- src/components/Tasks/TasksList.tsx (overflow fixes)
- src/constants/musicData.ts (key organization)
- src/types/index.ts (added tuning and lyrics fields)
```

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Simplified Ratings**: Changed from 1-5 stars to binary like/love system for simplicity
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Components handle missing database tables without crashing
3. **Responsive Layout**: 3-column grid on desktop, stacks on mobile
4. **Real-time Features**: Used Supabase subscriptions for live comment updates
5. **Dynamic Schema Detection**: Migration scripts detect existing columns to prevent errors
6. **Filename Sanitization**: Enhanced to handle apostrophes and special characters with retry logic

## Next Session Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Run `apply_tasks_migration.sql` to enable full Tasks functionality
2. Test rating system with multiple users for collaboration
3. Implement section-based ratings (timestamps for arrangement features)

### Medium Priority
1. Add user profiles to comments (fetch usernames properly)
2. Implement playlist feedback feature
3. Create smart playlists based on ratings ("all tracks with melody loved")

### Future Enhancements
1. Custom templates for different musician types (guitarists, pianists, etc.)
2. Section ratings for arrangement features
3. Export functionality for ratings data
4. Mobile-specific optimizations for rating interface

## Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New tables created this session:
- track_comments (id, track_id, user_id, comment, created_at, updated_at)
- track_detailed_ratings (id, track_id, category_id, user_id, rating_value, notes, created_at, updated_at)
- rating_categories (id, name, description, icon, color, created_by, track_id, is_global, display_order)
- rating_scales (id, category_id, scale_type, min_value, max_value, scale_labels, default_value)

-- New fields added:
- tracks.tuning (TEXT)
- tracks.lyrics (TEXT)
```

## Session Duration
- Start: Initial rating system request  
- Middle: Fixed critical user access issues
- End: Successfully deployed fixes to production
- Total Changes: 50+ files modified, 2 production deployments
- Key Commits: 
  - 8c891cd: Rating system implementation
  - 692b389: User access fixes

## Notes for Next Developer
- The rating system is fully functional but can be extended
- Comments need proper user profile integration for display names
- Tasks component works but needs its migration run (optional)
- All new components follow the existing design system (forest theme, yellow accents)
- Database migrations are safe to re-run (use IF NOT EXISTS checks)
- FileUpload.tsx has enhanced sanitization with retry logic for special characters
- fix_jg_user_SAFE.sql is the final working migration that adapts to any schema

## Critical Fixes Applied
- **view_preferences table**: Created with proper RLS policies to fix 406 errors
- **User profiles**: All auth users now have corresponding profile records
- **Filename sanitization**: Handles apostrophes, spaces, and special characters
- **Retry logic**: Automatic fallback to ultra-safe filenames if upload fails
