# CoreTet Current System Analysis

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Database Schema (Simplified)
After the rebuild, we have a clean, minimal structure:

1. **Core Tables**
   - `tracks` - Audio files with metadata
   - `playlists` - User-created playlists
   - `playlist_tracks` - Links tracks to playlists
   - `profiles` - Basic user profiles

2. **Rating Tables**
   - `personal_track_ratings` - Personal library ratings
   - `playlist_track_ratings` - Ratings within playlist context
   - `playlist_track_rating_summary` (view) - Aggregated ratings

3. **Removed Tables**
   - `playlist_shares` - Was causing complexity
   - `collaborators` - Old sharing system
   - Various permission tables

### Current Features Working
‚úÖ User authentication (Supabase Auth)
‚úÖ Track upload to Supabase Storage
‚úÖ Playlist creation and management
‚úÖ Personal track ratings
‚úÖ Secure file access via edge functions
‚úÖ Mobile PWA with offline capability
‚úÖ Audio playback with mobile optimizations

### Current Limitations
‚ùå No playlist sharing mechanism
‚ùå No collaborator management
‚ùå Playlist ratings exist but no sharing context
‚ùå No real-time updates between users

## üéØ Your Vision: Mobile-First Collaborative Playlists

### Requirements as I understand them:
1. **Share playlists with collaborators**
   - Simple sharing mechanism (email-based?)
   - Mobile/PWA optimized interface
   
2. **Collaborators can listen to shared playlists**
   - Access control (view-only vs. rate permissions)
   - Smooth mobile playback experience
   
3. **Rating system for shared tracks**
   - All collaborators see aggregated ratings
   - Individual rating privacy options?
   - Real-time or near real-time updates

## ü§î Implementation Considerations

### Option A: Lightweight Sharing (Recommended)
```sql
-- Single table approach
CREATE TABLE playlist_shares (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  playlist_id UUID REFERENCES playlists,
  shared_by UUID REFERENCES profiles,
  shared_with_email TEXT,
  permissions TEXT[], -- ['view', 'rate']
  share_token TEXT UNIQUE, -- For link-based sharing
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- Works well with existing RLS
- Mobile-friendly (share via link)
- No complex user management

**Cons:**
- Limited to email-based sharing
- No advanced permissions

### Option B: Full Collaboration System
```sql
-- Multiple tables for rich features
CREATE TABLE collaborators (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE playlist_collaborators (
  playlist_id UUID,
  collaborator_id UUID,
  role TEXT, -- 'viewer', 'rater', 'editor'
  invited_by UUID,
  accepted_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Pros:**
- Rich collaboration features
- Better for future expansion
- Professional feel

**Cons:**
- More complex to build/maintain
- Potential RLS complexity returns
- Heavier for mobile

### Option C: Public Link Sharing (Simplest)
```sql
-- Just add to playlists table
ALTER TABLE playlists ADD COLUMN 
  public_share_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  share_settings JSONB DEFAULT '{"allow_ratings": true}';
```

**Pros:**
- Dead simple
- No user management
- Perfect for mobile PWA
- Easy social sharing

**Cons:**
- Less control over access
- No user attribution for ratings

## üì± Mobile-First Considerations

### Current Mobile Setup
- PWA manifest configured
- Service worker for offline
- Wake lock for playback
- Media session API
- Touch-optimized UI

### For Sharing Enhancement
1. **Share Flow**
   - Native share API integration
   - QR codes for in-person sharing
   - Deep linking support

2. **Collaborative Features**
   - WebSocket for real-time rating updates
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Offline rating queue

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy load shared playlists
   - Cache shared playlist data
   - Minimize API calls

## üîê Security Considerations

### Current Security
- RLS policies on all tables
- Signed URLs for audio files
- User isolation working well

### For Sharing
- Need to maintain security while enabling access
- Consider token-based access for non-users
- Rate limiting for public shares
- Audit trail for shared content

## üí≠ Questions for You

1. **User Management**
   - Do collaborators need accounts?
   - Or is anonymous rating OK?
   - Email verification required?

2. **Sharing Scope**
   - Share entire playlists only?
   - Or individual tracks too?
   - Time-limited shares?

3. **Rating Visibility**
   - Show who rated what?
   - Or just aggregated numbers?
   - Private vs. public ratings?

4. **Mobile Experience**
   - Native app eventual goal?
   - PWA sufficient for now?
   - Offline rating sync important?

5. **Scale Considerations**
   - How many collaborators per playlist?
   - How many shared playlists per user?
   - Real-time updates critical?

## üöÄ Recommended Path Forward

Based on the current clean architecture, I suggest:

1. **Phase 1: Simple Link Sharing**
   - Add public_share_id to playlists
   - Create share links with tokens
   - Anonymous rating with localStorage

2. **Phase 2: Email-Based Sharing**
   - Add lightweight playlist_shares table
   - Send email invites
   - Track who's rating

3. **Phase 3: Real-time Collaboration**
   - Add WebSocket support
   - Live rating updates
   - Presence indicators

This approach:
- Maintains the clean architecture
- Starts simple, evolves naturally
- Mobile-first at each step
- Avoids the RLS complexity we just escaped
