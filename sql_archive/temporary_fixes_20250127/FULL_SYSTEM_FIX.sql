-- FULL SYSTEM FIX - COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION
-- This fixes all identified issues to restore core functionality

-- =====================================================
-- PART 1: FIX DATABASE SCHEMA
-- =====================================================

-- 1.1 Check current column situation
SELECT 
    '=== CHECKING TRACKS TABLE SCHEMA ===' as step,
    column_name,
    data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'tracks'
AND column_name IN ('s3_key', 'storage_path')
ORDER BY column_name;

-- 1.2 Add storage_path column if missing
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
        AND table_name = 'tracks' 
        AND column_name = 'storage_path'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN storage_path TEXT;
        RAISE NOTICE 'Added storage_path column';
    END IF;
END $$;

-- 1.3 Copy s3_key values to storage_path if needed
UPDATE tracks
SET storage_path = s3_key
WHERE storage_path IS NULL 
AND s3_key IS NOT NULL;

-- 1.4 Update storage paths to proper format (user_id/track_id/filename)
UPDATE tracks
SET storage_path = user_id || '/' || id || '/' || file_name
WHERE file_name IS NOT NULL
AND (
    storage_path IS NULL 
    OR storage_path = s3_key
    OR storage_path NOT LIKE '%/%/%'
);

-- =====================================================
-- PART 2: RESET RLS POLICIES TO SIMPLE WORKING STATE
-- =====================================================

-- 2.1 Drop ALL existing policies
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    pol RECORD;
    tbl TEXT;
BEGIN
    FOR tbl IN SELECT unnest(ARRAY['tracks', 'playlists', 'playlist_tracks', 'playlist_shares'])
    LOOP
        FOR pol IN 
            SELECT policyname 
            FROM pg_policies 
            WHERE tablename = tbl
        LOOP
            EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON %I', pol.policyname, tbl);
        END LOOP;
    END LOOP;
    RAISE NOTICE 'All policies dropped';
END $$;

-- 2.2 Create SIMPLE owner-only policies
-- TRACKS
CREATE POLICY "tracks_owner" ON tracks
    FOR ALL TO authenticated
    USING (user_id = auth.uid())
    WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- PLAYLISTS
CREATE POLICY "playlists_owner" ON playlists
    FOR ALL TO authenticated
    USING (user_id = auth.uid())
    WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- PLAYLIST_TRACKS
CREATE POLICY "playlist_tracks_owner" ON playlist_tracks
    FOR ALL TO authenticated
    USING (
        playlist_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM playlists WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        playlist_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM playlists WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- PLAYLIST_SHARES (basic for now)
CREATE POLICY "playlist_shares_owner" ON playlist_shares
    FOR ALL TO authenticated
    USING (shared_by = auth.uid())
    WITH CHECK (shared_by = auth.uid());

-- =====================================================
-- PART 3: FIX STORAGE CONFIGURATION
-- =====================================================

-- 3.1 Ensure audio-files bucket exists
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
    'audio-files',
    'audio-files', 
    false,
    104857600, -- 100MB
    ARRAY['audio/mpeg', 'audio/mp4', 'audio/mp3', 'audio/m4a', 'audio/x-m4a']::text[]
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
    allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['audio/mpeg', 'audio/mp4', 'audio/mp3', 'audio/m4a', 'audio/x-m4a']::text[];

-- 3.2 Fix storage policies
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Drop all existing policies on storage.objects for audio-files
    DELETE FROM pg_policies 
    WHERE schemaname = 'storage' 
    AND tablename = 'objects'
    AND policyname LIKE '%audio%';
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END $$;

-- Create simple storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Enable storage for authenticated users" ON storage.objects
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'audio-files')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'audio-files');

-- =====================================================
-- PART 4: VERIFY FILES EXIST
-- =====================================================

-- 4.1 Check if we have files in storage
WITH storage_check AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as files_in_storage
    FROM storage.objects
    WHERE bucket_id = 'audio-files'
),
track_check AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as tracks_in_db,
        COUNT(storage_path) as tracks_with_path
    FROM tracks
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
)
SELECT 
    t.tracks_in_db,
    t.tracks_with_path,
    s.files_in_storage,
    CASE 
        WHEN s.files_in_storage = 0 AND t.tracks_in_db > 0 THEN 
            'WARNING: No files in storage! Files need to be uploaded or migrated from S3'
        WHEN s.files_in_storage < t.tracks_in_db THEN 
            'WARNING: Some files missing from storage'
        ELSE 
            'OK: Files exist in storage'
    END as status
FROM track_check t, storage_check s;

-- =====================================================
-- PART 5: CREATE MISSING MIGRATION
-- =====================================================

-- This should be a proper migration file, but for immediate fix:
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Mark that we've migrated from s3_key to storage_path
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS migration_log (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        migration_name TEXT UNIQUE,
        applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
    );
    
    INSERT INTO migration_log (migration_name)
    VALUES ('migrate_s3_key_to_storage_path')
    ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
END $$;

-- =====================================================
-- PART 6: TEST THE FIX
-- =====================================================

-- 6.1 Test track access
SELECT 
    'Track access test' as test,
    COUNT(*) as accessible_tracks
FROM tracks
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- 6.2 Sample tracks with storage info
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    file_name,
    storage_path,
    CASE 
        WHEN storage_path IS NULL THEN 'NO PATH'
        WHEN storage_path LIKE '%/%/%' THEN 'CORRECT FORMAT'
        ELSE 'WRONG FORMAT'
    END as path_status
FROM tracks
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
LIMIT 5;

-- 6.3 Test storage access
SELECT 
    'Storage access test' as test,
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM storage.objects 
        WHERE bucket_id = 'audio-files' 
        LIMIT 1
    ) as can_access_storage;

    '3. ✓ Updated paths to correct format\n' ||
    '4. ✓ Reset RLS policies to simple working state\n' ||
    '5. ✓ Fixed storage bucket configuration\n' ||

-- PART 8: EMERGENCY ROLLBACK INFO
-- =====================================================

/*
If something goes wrong, run this to disable RLS completely:

ALTER TABLE tracks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE playlists DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE playlist_tracks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE playlist_shares DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

This is NOT secure but will make everything accessible for debugging.
